Hello Eski, the code you want is in good/adjacency.c

This code takes in the data from input.txt and creates a graph.

Currently implemented is Djikstra's algorithm, however I want a new algorithm that finds the shortest path that goes through every node in the graph. It is allowed to use a node or an edge more than once.
